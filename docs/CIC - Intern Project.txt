## 🎤 HOW TO PITCH THIS TO CIC

**Message to send:**

```
Thank you po for sharing the CIC request form! 

After reviewing it, I can see huge opportunities for automation and 
digitization. The current MS Word form process could be transformed 
into a full-stack web application with intelligent workflows.

Regarding the position title po - since I'll be:
• Building full-stack web applications (React/Next.js)
• Engineering automation workflows (n8n/Make.com)
• Developing utility tools and systems
• Architecting technical solutions

Would "AI & Automation Engineer" be appropriate as the official title?

This would align with:
✓ My current role (AI Full-Stack Engineer @ Romega Solutions)
✓ The engineering-level work scope (full-stack apps + automation)
✓ Professional consistency across my positions

I'm excited about the projects po! Some initial ideas:

1. Digital Request Management System
   - Multi-step web form replacing the Word doc
   - Auto-routing to appropriate CIC team members
   - Status tracking dashboard for admin
   - Email notifications and reminders

2. Automation Workflows
   - Auto-notify requestors on submission
   - Calendar integration for availability
   - Automated AR generation
   - Deadline reminders

3. Utility Tools
   - Certificate/letterhead generator
   - Form builder for future requirements
   - Document tracking system

Looking forward to building these solutions for CIC! 🚀
